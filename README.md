# VBA-challenge
assignment 2
In this assignment we have to use VBA to analyse stock market data for four quarters

Using VBA we calculated 
    Quarterly change of a stock from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter
    The percentage change of a stock from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter
    total stock volume of each stock
    Calculated stock with greatest % increase, greatest % decrease and greatest total volume
    Also added conditional formatting to querterly change and percent change
