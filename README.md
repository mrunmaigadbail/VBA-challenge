Using VBA we calculated

2. The percentage change of a stock from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter
3. total stock volume of each stock
4. Calculated stock with greatest % increase, greatest % decrease and greatest total volume
5. Also added conditional formatting to querterly change and percent change
